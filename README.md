# CLOVER
CLOVER (Continuous Lifetime Optimisation of Variable Electricity Resources) is a modelling framework enabling the simulation and optimisation of community-scale energy systems, typically minigrids, to support energy access in developing countries [[1]](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04799). It is a framework under constant development, with new features being added, and has been applied to many different scenarios and case studies. (See the [publications page](publications.html) for more information.)
